# PsytechVR

Our project aims to develop an advanced Virtual Reality (VR) therapy system enhanced by generative AI, designed to revolutionize mental health treatment across various sectors including private clinics, healthcare organizations, home therapy providers, educational institutions, corporate HR departments, and potentially correctional facilities. Key features include a personalized treatment scenarios generated by AI, real-time session monitoring via a specialist control launchpad, and detailed analytics through a robust dashboard. This technology facilitates real-time patient monitoring, enhances therapeutic outcomes, and supports remote treatment continuity. Future developments include enhancing immersive experiences with walkable environments, addressing contemporary mental health needs exacerbated by global crises like those in Ukraine and Gaza

# Instructions

1. Download Unity Hub version 2022.3.46f1. The link can be found here: https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive
2. download this repository, and set it as a project.
3. Open the Project. The various Scenes and their Capabilities are listed below.


# DepthMap Testing

Incomplete, but essentially allows for testing turning a 360 degree image into a depth map, then a dome with depth demonstrated. Within the Main Camera, there are several scripts that serve as various parts of the pipeline. With all of them enabled, it may take over a minute for the scripts to load and run.

Location: Assets -> Scenes

1. Depth Map Testing: largely obsolete. Intended for 2D images, should remain disabled for most purposes.
2. Depth Map 360: Insert a Depth Map in the "Depth Map" variable. Insert the 360 image on environment image, or the depth map if you want further illustration of the depth results. Set the ShaderMat to "ClarityMat" for the clearest results. Depth Scale determines the size of the "Dome".
3. Depth Material Creator: Experimental program to create a Unity Material from a shader and input image. Largely obsolete.
4. Depth Material Loader: connects to the python Depth Map Program. Processes an image on the input image path, and outputs it on the output image path. Both are default set to be images within Assets -> Materials.
